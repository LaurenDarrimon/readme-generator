### Description
As of January 2022, the US is seeing the highest Covid levels on record and tests are in demand now more than ever. We wanted to give users a place to quickly and easily find Covid testing sites in their area. It was our goal to make the website interface simple, clutter-free and easy to use. Our app currently works within the United States. It uses the Google Maps API to retrieve the users location and communicates that to the Here Developer API which provides detailed information about the testing sites.
